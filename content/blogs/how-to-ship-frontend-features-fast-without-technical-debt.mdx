Every project starts with excitement and ends with a deadline.

The dangerous part is the middle, where speed starts to fight quality.

Over time, I settled on a simple frontend workflow that helps me ship quickly without creating future pain.

## Build the "ugly but true" version first

I start with the minimum version that proves the idea works:

- no polished styles
- no abstractions
- no "perfect" architecture

If the feature does not solve a real user problem in this version, better styling will not save it.

## Add guardrails before adding polish

Once the feature works, I add only the guardrails that matter:

- strict TypeScript types on inputs and outputs
- basic loading/error states
- one or two tests on the risky behavior

This is where many bugs die early.

## Refactor only after behavior is stable

Refactoring too early is just guesswork.

I only extract helpers, components, or utilities after seeing repeated patterns in real code. If I copy a pattern three times, I refactor it on the fourth.

That rule keeps abstractions practical instead of theoretical.

## My rule of thumb

Speed is not "writing fast."

Speed is reducing how often you need to rewrite the same thing.

If your code is clear enough that Future You can understand it in 30 seconds, you are moving fast in the only way that compounds.
