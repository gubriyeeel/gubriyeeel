My first MDX setup felt fragile.

One small config change would break parsing, imports, or build output.

After a few rebuilds, I realized the issue was not MDX itself. It was me trying to treat content like an afterthought.

## The shift: content is part of the app

When I started treating content as product data, everything got easier.

I now keep a clear flow:

- `content/` as the source of truth
- a schema to validate frontmatter
- generated typed output consumed by pages/components

That gives me a clean contract between writing and rendering.

## What improved immediately

### 1) Fewer runtime surprises

Schema validation catches bad frontmatter before production.

### 2) Cleaner rendering

MDX components stay focused on presentation, not data wrangling.

### 3) Better writing momentum

Because structure is stable, writing a new post feels like filling a template, not debugging infra.

## The practical lesson

MDX is worth it if you keep the system boring.

If your content flow is predictable, you can spend your energy on ideas, stories, and examples instead of fighting tooling.

You can see how I apply the same thinking in real product work on my [Projects page](/projects).
